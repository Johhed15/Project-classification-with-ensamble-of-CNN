# This repository contains a project on sport classification, creating an ensemble model from 3 different transefer learned CNN-models. 

## It was developed as a final project for a deep learning course at Ume√• University. Please note that while the code and results pertain to the final project, the comments and text were originally created for another dataset.

The code is written in pythonon on kaggle!

Comments are made in swedish as i did this in my bachelor.
